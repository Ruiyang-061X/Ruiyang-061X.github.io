# 👋 About Me
I received my bachelor degree from School of Computer Science, Fudan University in 2021.6. After graduation, I worked as a Backend Development Engineer in Meituan, Shanghai for 2 years. Now I have quit from Meituan and try to seek my path in the academy world. My research interests lie in Computer Vison and related topics.

Speech Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network
- Collect speech dataset of 20 chinese words from about 40 students in the class
- Extract feature through FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) and train a CNN to classify a speech into 20 words
- Get 100% accuracy at the final test by teacher using his own voice, and get a A score of this class
